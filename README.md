TailrSwift
==========

I have no idea what I'm doing!
------------------------------

This is my first iOS project ever. So I'm trying to learn both 
iOS/UIKit and Swift at the same time.

A simple music app
------------------

My idea is to make a very simple music app where the UI consists
of a grid of boxes. A cursor should sweep from left to right over
the boxes and play a note for any active box. The boxes are
activated/deactivated by tapping them.

The pitch is determined by the row index (first row is brightest, 
last row is darkest).
